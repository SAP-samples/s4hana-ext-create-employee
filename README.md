# SAP S/4HANA Cloud Extensions - SAP S/4HANA Cloud App for One-Click User Creation
This repository contains the sample code for the [SAP S/4HANA Cloud App for One-Click User Creation tutorial](http://tiny.cc/s4-create-employee).

*This code is only one part of the tutorial, so please follow the tutorial before attempting to use this code.*

## Description

SAP S/4HANA Cloud App for One-Click User Creation is an admin side-by-side extension scenario. Within the scenario, you use the Create Employee and IDP User app to make the creation of new employees and users - along with business role assignments - easier for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, as the user is also created in the IDP. It puts several manual admin tasks, that would usually need to be performed in different UIs, into one UI.
